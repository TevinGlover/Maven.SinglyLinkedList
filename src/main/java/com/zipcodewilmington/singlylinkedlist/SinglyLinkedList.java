 * what is a node ?
 * n the context of data structures, a "node" is a fundamental building block used to
 * construct various types of linked data structures, such as linked lists, trees, and graphs.

 * Data: This is the information or payload that the node holds.
 * It could be a single value or a collection of values depending on the application.
 * Next (or Link/Reference): This is a reference or link to the next node in a sequence
 * (in the case of a linked list) or to child nodes (in the case of a tree or graph).
 * If the node is the last one in a sequence, this reference is typically set to null
 * or a sentinel value to indicate the end.
 * For example, in the context of a singly linked list, a node might look like this in a
 * simple Java representation:
